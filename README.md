📘 Project Overview

The Hotel Room Reservation System (HRRS) is a console-based, menu-driven Java application designed to simulate a real-world hotel room booking process. The system enables users to manage customer details, view available rooms, reserve rooms based on type and duration, calculate booking charges, and display reservation summaries.

The application is developed using core Java and follows a modular, object-oriented design to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Each functional component of the system is implemented as a separate module, promoting clean separation of concerns and ease of understanding.

The system incorporates essential Java programming concepts such as classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, enums, wrapper classes, exception handling, and multithreading. Invalid user inputs are handled gracefully using custom exceptions, ensuring robust execution without unexpected program termination.

Designed as a command-line application, HRRS provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that continuously interacts with the user until termination. The use of multithreading simulates parallel real-life hotel operations such as reservation confirmation and invoice generation.

Overall, this project demonstrates the practical application of object-oriented programming principles to solve a real-life problem using Java, making it suitable for academic evaluation, learning purposes, and foundational software design practice.
